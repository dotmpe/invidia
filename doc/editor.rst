Schema Editor
=============

jdorn/json-editor is a fine editor for web-enabled use. What about command line.

jonhiggs/question may provide a minimal shell helper, but that is for another project.

jsonwidget http://blog.robla.net/2010/jsonwidget-python/ looks like the real deal, but does it work.
Can open an empty json dit file with schema. But error on creating new (with var/schema/sugarcrm.json)

Looking for sources -- personal website is down. Downloading schema/example data to test.
https://bitbucket.org/robla/jsonwidget-python/

But still getting same error again and again::

	jsonedit -s var/schema/address.json var/simpleaddr.json

So does not seem to be problem with schema, can't see any anyway. Can't get this to work.
